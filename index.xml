      <description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;m officially part of the DSSL at Virginia Tech (Hey! I&amp;rsquo;m in the Slack group. That&amp;rsquo;s totes official), I&amp;rsquo;ve got access to their servers to work on projects and stuff. I&amp;rsquo;m working with one of the PhD students in the lab on a project involving prefetching Docker layers from a registry and caching Docker layers to serve them faster, but also involves choosing the right layers to prefetch to maximize cache hits.</description>

      <description>I had a bit of a problem. I was writing an app that would send me email reminders. It would store the reminder data in an ETS table and check it every 24 hours to see if were any reminders to send. The app would run quietly as a background process in my computer as long as the computer was running. Now I wanted it to read events from a csv file to add into the table.</description>

      <title>A Problem with Git Stash</title>

      <description>Before going any further I probably need to explain what pre-commit hooks are. So Git has a facility called hooks which allow you to specify a script to execute or a command to run when some event happens. Pre-commit hooks are hooks that run before, you guessed it, a commit. There exists a single file called pre-commit in the .git/hooks directory in your git repository which will run as a script before every commit.</description>

      <title>Trying out Flutter</title>

      <description>Flutter, Google&amp;rsquo;s Dart based SDK for building native mobile applications, has been around for a while and I finally decided to take it for a spin. I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted at mobile app development before in Android but never got past Android Studio&amp;rsquo;s terrible slowness. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because my computer is kinda old. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t change how bad the experience was. Also, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get Java through my head. It was more than a bit overwhelming to try and learn.</description>

      <title>(Attempting to) Read Papers: Times, Clocks and Ordering of Events</title>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: This is not a detailed explanation of the paper, but rather just my thoughts on it.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get started on reading CS papers with a mediocre amount of success. I started with the Byzantine Generals paper but that sort of melted my brain. It was a case of me going &amp;ldquo;Holy shit, I get it!&amp;rdquo; followed by &amp;ldquo;Goddamnit, I don&amp;rsquo;t get it&amp;rdquo; again and again before I threw it away.</description>

      <description>This was supposed to be my grand comeback to my millions thousands hundreds dozens maybe one reader where I would teach them the ways of Elm and functional programming in the browser from atop my glorious Mountain of Enlightenment in a blog post that would teach them how to make the Eye of Doom!!!!!! (which is just this SVG drawing that looks more like a sunny side up egg than an eye, that follows your mouse around).</description>

      <description>The greatest holy war our world has ever witnessed was fought between the Church of Emacs and the Cult of Vim. For over thirty years, the two sides have been waging this war on all fronts: forums, chat rooms, even face-to-face. Many have been sacrificed and many have been martyred fighting for the editor they believed should reign supreme. But it is not all tales of glory on the battlefield, despite what historians on both sides would have you believe.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had this thought in my head. A question, really. And I don&amp;rsquo;t know if there is or will be any answer for it. Maybe you can answer it.
But before I can ask the question to you, I need to set up some background. Get you to understand where I&amp;rsquo;m coming from. And so, here&amp;rsquo;s a blog post in three acts.

      <description>Happy New Year everybody!!
Yes I know I&amp;rsquo;m a week late. Sue me.
What a week its been! I attended my very first &amp;ldquo;real hackers don&amp;rsquo;t sleep&amp;rdquo; 2 day hackathon! I got sick at my very first &amp;ldquo;real hackers don&amp;rsquo;t sleep&amp;rdquo; 2 day hackathon! I threw up at my very first &amp;ldquo;real hackers don&amp;rsquo;t sleep&amp;rdquo; 2 day hackathon! And then I swore that I would never again attend any &amp;ldquo;real hackers don&amp;rsquo;t sleep&amp;rdquo; 2 day hackathons ever again!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;M BACK BOIIII!!
Man it&amp;rsquo;s good to have internet again! That storm did a number on my city but we&amp;rsquo;re getting back up now. In order to keep my brain from oozing out from sheer boredom during the day, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing nothing but reading this past week. Thought I&amp;rsquo;d share my opinions on a couple of books in this comeback post. Here we go!
(Note: None of the books below are programming or tech related.</description>

      <title>Thanking the Reddit bots for their hard work</title>

      <description>You know, I was supposed to be learning SQLAlchemy in the hopes adding something employable my resume (all I have right now is &amp;lsquo;knows some python&amp;rsquo;). But I end up messing around on reddit instead. Sigh.
Anyway, if you&amp;rsquo;ve used reddit for any length of time, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed a few bot accounts. They&amp;rsquo;re usually there to perform some tasks on behalf of the humans. Automoderator is ubiquitous throughout reddit. RemindMeBot can be called on demand to set a reminder for yourself by calling for it in the comments or via PM.</description>

      <description>I realize that the posting schedule has gone to whack but that last post was too long to finish in one day. And so I decided I could skip a day as a reward (not that I dislike writing these, mind! But I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to overextend myself). Also I realize this is not necessarily a technical post but it is something I need to address, for my own sake.</description>

      <description>I love Neal Stephenson&amp;rsquo;s books. He is the God Uncle of cyberpunk (the Godfather of cyberpunk is, of course, William Gibson). One of Stephenson&amp;rsquo;s doorstoppers is Cryptonomicon, a MASSIVE, 1100+ page monstrosity jam packed with everything you could want in a historical fiction/sorta cyberpunk novel. It&amp;rsquo;s got action, World War II code breaking, guest appearances by Alan Turing, digressions on cryptography, a few predictions about the future (internet banking being one of them.</description>

      <description>Oh hey. You&amp;rsquo;re back. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;d write another post.
Yeah, well, I said I would, didn&amp;rsquo;t I? So here I am. But it&amp;rsquo;s not like I have anything interesting to say though. I thought I would learn enough in two days to write something interesting. But the most interesting thing I did that I have any coherent thoughts about is that I shaved my head.
Sigh I want to write but at the same time I don&amp;rsquo;t want to fill this blog up with rambling crap (unless its entertaining crap).</description>

      <description>This is a blog post. The first in (hopefully) a series. A series of blog posts where I write about whatever is on my mind, probably mostly about computer stuff that I&amp;rsquo;m doing. An activity log, if you will. Maybe writing this is a way to organize my thoughts. Does it work? I don&amp;rsquo;t know! I only just started. I also find that announcing out loud that I&amp;rsquo;m going to do something severely decreases the chance of it ever getting done.</description>

      <description>I have a problem. I have spent more time in the last month setting up and tinkering with an environment for me to code in than I have in actual coding. This is not a good thing, especially for someone who is a total novice like I am who definitely needs to sharpen his skills.
With studies and other stuff eating up most of my time, I have relatively little time to spend to do this thing that I love so much.</description>
