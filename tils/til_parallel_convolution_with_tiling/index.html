    <h1 class="title"> TIL Parallel Convolution with Tiling in GPUs </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>In the continued saga of &ldquo;Subil learns how to program GPUs&rdquo;, today I learned
about convolution and how to program it for a GPU.</p>

<p>What is convolution? Well, I learned just enough so that I&rsquo;m satisfied with how it works, but
definitely not enough to explain it with any depth in this post. See <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-convolution/">this
article</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA">this
video</a> for explanations.</p>

<p>For my purposes, convolution is this: For each input element in a 2D matrix of size NxN, apply a
function on it that takes that input element and some of its neighboring
elements (so your input to the function is a smaller nxn matrix with your input
element at the center), multiplies this smaller matrix by a another known nxn matrix
called a <em>convolution kernel</em> or <em>convolution filter</em> and sums these multiplied elements together to
produce one output element. The width of a convolution filter is <code>2r+1</code> where
<code>r</code> is the radius of the filter. In the below example, we have a filter of
radius <code>r=1</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/TILs/TIL_parallel_convolution_with_tiling/TIL_parallel_convolution_convolution_example.jpg" alt="Parallel convolution
example" title="small diagram showing convolution with a filter" /></p>

<p>This type of operation is done a lot in image processing. For example one way to
blur an image: for each input pixel of an image, take its surrounding pixels so you
have a 3x3 grid of pixels with your input pixel at the center, then multiply
this by another grid that looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#fff;background-color:#111;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">0.11|0.11|0.11
----|----|----
0.11|0.11|0.11
----|----|----
0.11|0.11|0.11</pre></div>
<p>then sum the values together to
get the new pixel value for the output. Doing this for each pixel will blur the image. Our grid of
0.11s is our <em>convolution filter</em> .</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a short Python program that does this</p>

<p>(This is a super contrived example because 0.11 is basically <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>, so you&rsquo;re
multiplying your 3x3 pixel grid centered on your input pixel with a grid of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> s
and then summing your grid. This is no different from taking the average of the
values in the 3x3 pixel grid for each input pixel. But I wanted to demonstrate
this because your convolution filter could be anything, not just a grid of
0.11s).</p>

<p>Anyway now that I&rsquo;ve explained what convolution is, let&rsquo;s look at programming it for a GPU.</p>

<p>A simple algorithm for convolution on GPU is to start a number of blocks and
threads such that you have one thread for each output element of your 2D matrix.
The thread will be responsible for taking the nxn grid of the input elements,
multiplying it with the convolution filter, and summing it to produce the output
element. This can be made more efficient if all the threads in the block work
together to load an input <em>tile</em> of elements into shared memory to save on
redundant memory accesses (I discuss this in more detail in my <a href="/tils/til_corner_turning">blog post on
corner turning</a>).</p>

<p>However, there&rsquo;s a couple of things to keep in mind. If you&rsquo;re calculating the output element you need the
nxn input element grid, so you need to make sure your tile contains those input
elements. So the number of output elements calculated from the inputs in the
tile is going to be less than the number of inputs in the tile. You can&rsquo;t
calculate the output element for an input element that is at the border of a
tile since that would require the surrounding input elements, some of which lie
outside of the tile.</p>

<p>Say we had the below input tile loaded by the threads in the block (the block is
sized such that it is the same size as the input tile, and one thread loads one
element into the input tile) and our filter radius was 1 (so the filter size
would 3x3, and the required input grid would also be 3x3). To calculate the
output element for the corresponding input element that is at the corner, we
would need additional input elements from around it to form the input grid. But
those don&rsquo;t exist. So we can&rsquo;t calculate that output element. We can calculate
the output of the inner elements in the tile, but not those at the border. The
distance from the border of the input tile must be equal to the filter radius or
more for the output element to not require any input elements that lie outside
the tile.</p>

<p><img src="/img/TILs/TIL_parallel_convolution_with_tiling/TIL_parallel_convolution_calculating_output_border.jpg" alt="Calculating element at border" title="Showing how its not possible to calculate output from input at the border of
the input tile, only
inputs from filter radius distance from the border" /></p>

<p>So this means that after the tile is loaded into shared memory, some threads in
the block will be inactive since they are not going to be calculating any output
element.</p>

<p>Another thing is that when the input matrix is being divided up among the
blocks to load as tiles, there needs to be some slight overlap between the tiles
loaded by different blocks so that the output elements that can&rsquo;t be calculated
by one block (because the elements are at the border of the tile) will be
calculated by a neighboring block that includes those elements and enough of its
surrounding elements.</p>

<p>In the below image, we have a filter of radius 1 (so filter size is 3x3), each
block is 5x5 threads so it will load a 5x5 input tile into shared memory. The
neighboring block will load an input tile that will overlap with the elements
loaded by the previous block so that those output elements that cannot be
calculated by the first block will be calculated by the second block. In this
overlapping manner, several blocks are created that will cover the whole input
matrix.</p>

<p><img src="/img/TILs/TIL_parallel_convolution_with_tiling/TIL_parallel_convolution_block_overlap.jpg" alt="Overlapping input tiles by blocks" title="Input tiles loaded by blocks overlap with each other so that all output
elements are calculated for all input elements and none are missed because they
are on the border of one the input tiles. " /></p>

<p>One more thing to keep in mind is that there needs to be a way to calculate the
output elements for inputs that are on the borders of the input matrix. However,
there are no input elements beyond the border of the actual input matrix that
also need to be loaded for the output elements on the border to be calculated. So
what do you do? The solution there is to use some default value like 0 instead.
A block loading an input tile when it sees it needs to load an element outside
the bounds of the input matrix, will instead set that value in the input tile
to 0 or some other default value. These are called <em>ghost cells</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/TILs/TIL_parallel_convolution_with_tiling/TIL_parallel_convolution_ghost_cells.jpg" alt="Loading input tiles with ghost cells" title="Input tiles loaded at the border of the input matrix will load ghost cells with
default values for those inputs that are requested from outside the bounds of
the input matrix" /></p>

<p>In general, the element loaded by a thread in a block into an input tile is determined by</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#fff;background-color:#111;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">FILTER_RADIUS = f

<span style="color:#080;background-color:#0f140f;font-style:italic"># INPUT_TILE_DIM is the size of input tile and also the block size</span>

col = blockIdx.x * OUTPUT_TILE_DIM + threadIdx.x - FILTER_RADIUS
row = blockIdx.y * OUTPUT_TILE_DIM + threadIdx.y - FILTER_RADIUS</code></pre></div>
<p>Where each input tile loaded by a block starts and which output elements are
calculated given the input tile is a little hard to visualize. So I have a
Jupyter Notebook that visualizes this. You can download it <a href="/extras/tiled_convolution_visualization.ipynb">here</a> or open it at
<a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/secondspass/secondspass.github.io/HEAD?labpath=extras%2Ftiled_convolution_visualization.ipynb">this Binder link</a>.</p>

<p>With all of this hand, you can convolve the whole input matrix given the
convolution filter.</p>

<p>(Of course, later I learn that instead of doing this complicated way of having an
input tile and then calculating output for only a subset of elements in the
input tile because you don&rsquo;t have
all the input elements needed in the input tile, you can instead simply
not worry about it. Instead you can load up the input tile, and if you want to
calculate the output of an element at the border of the input tile, then just
read the required surrounding input elements from the input matrix directly if
they&rsquo;re not in the input tile. This is relying on the GPU&rsquo;s caching mechanism
where multiple threads might try to load that same element from outside the tile so
it will be cached, counteracting any performance penalty you might see from
having to read from the input matrix directly instead of from the tile in shared
memory.)</p>

<p>I should also note that the convolution I describe above also works for 1D and
3D matrices, I&rsquo;m just using 2D matrices for my example for ease of explanation.</p>
