    <h1 class="title"> A couple of handy tools if you are sshing into servers </h1>
    <div class="content"> 

<p>Now that I&rsquo;m officially part of the <a href="http://dssl.cs.vt.edu">DSSL</a> at Virginia Tech (Hey! I&rsquo;m
in the Slack group. That&rsquo;s totes official), I&rsquo;ve got access to their servers to work on
projects and stuff. I&rsquo;m working with one of the PhD students in the lab on a
project involving prefetching Docker layers from a registry and caching Docker layers to
serve them faster, but also involves choosing the right layers to prefetch to maximize cache
hits. That last sentence probably doesn&rsquo;t explain much but I promise to write more about it
soon.</p>

<p>Part of my work right now (actually, all of my work right now) involves sshing
into the lab&rsquo;s servers through their gateway to write code and run simulations on some existing
data from Ali Anwar&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/chalianwar/docker-performance">work</a>. I&rsquo;ve
picked up a couple of useful tools to make that work easier for me.</p>

<h2 id="tramp-mode">TRAMP mode</h2>

<p><strong>Are you tired of sshing into a machine and dealing with plain, boring Vim (or worse, Nano)?</strong></p>

<p><em>Vigorously nods head</em></p>

<p><strong>Are you tired of having to configure your dotfiles whenever you ssh into a new machine?</strong></p>

<p><em>Vigorous nodding intensifies</em></p>

<p><strong>Do you find yourself sshing into someone else&rsquo;s machine to work and don&rsquo;t want to mess
with configurations because you are a guest here and you want to be courteous</strong></p>

<p><em>A veritable hurricane of nodding</em></p>

<p><strong>Do you use Emacs?</strong></p>

<p><em>The intense energy of the nodding produces nuclear fusion, powering the Earth for several years</em></p>

<p><strong>Say no more, my family! TRAMP mode is the solution you need.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/">TRAMP</a> for Emacs is an absolute boon. I can use Vim
just fine (I have Vim keybindings for Emacs after all, the heathen that I am). But I had
so many customizations to Emacs that going to plain Vim felt like a downgrade. Also
considering that I am working on someone else&rsquo;s machine on someone else&rsquo;s account, I did
not want to change things to suit my personal comfort. It&rsquo;s not my place to do so.</p>

<p>With TRAMP, you can edit files on the remote machine using the
Emacs on your own machine, with your keybindings and plugins and everything still
intact. You are editing a buffer on your local machine but saving the file will save it on
the remote machine. It comes built in to Emacs and can be used with <code>find-file</code> with a
special syntax.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#fff;background-color:#111;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">C-x C-f /ssh:user@remotehost#port:/path/to/file</pre></div>
<p>This is great and all, but in order to access the node, I would first need to hop through a
gateway server. TRAMP supports this as well. It&rsquo;s simply using the pipe <code>|</code> operator to
chain the hops.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#fff;background-color:#111;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">C-x C-f /ssh:user@gateway#port|ssh:user@node#port:/path/to/file</pre></div>
<p>The <code>#port</code> part can be omitted if the remote machines are using their default ssh
ports. TRAMP also supports more than two hops with pipes, though I
haven&rsquo;t had need for it yet.</p>

<h2 id="tmux">Tmux</h2>

<p>If you are sshing into machines to do more than one thing at a time, you are doing
yourself a disservice if you don&rsquo;t learn
<a href="https://danielmiessler.com/study/tmux/">Tmux</a>. Tmux has a few important selling points,
that the previous link goes over. The main one for me is the ability to detach and
reattach sessions allowing me to close and log out of my terminal while confident that the
work on the remote machine will keep running and that I can get back to it at any time
(though keep in mind that you will lose the connection and therefore your work if you
shutdown the machine in which you opened the Tmux session). I open Tmux sessions on the
gateway server which means I can detach from the session and logout. When I log back in to
the gateway server later, I can re-attach to the session I left.</p>

<p>Another selling point is that I can split the terminal window into multiple panes and
switch between them at will. This is far more convenient than arranging multiple terminals
and tabbing between them. It also makes me look hacker as fuck.</p>

<p>Those are the two main things that I&rsquo;ve found to be super handy when working with remote
systems. There may be other cool tools that I don&rsquo;t know about yet so I&rsquo;m going to keep an
eye out.</p>
