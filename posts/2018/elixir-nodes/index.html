    <h1 class="title"> Elixir Nodes are Cool </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>I had a bit of a problem. I was writing an <a href="https://github.com/secondspass/reminder">app</a> that would send me email reminders. It
would store the reminder data in an ETS table and check it every 24 hours to see if were
any reminders to send. The app would run quietly as a background process in my computer as
long as the computer was running. Now I wanted it to read events from a csv file to add
into the table. Of course, one way was to pass in the csv file as a config option that
would be read when the app starts or set the app to check the csv file for changes. But I
did not want it to as I felt that reading a csv file everytime it started was worse than
initializing from a DETS table, which is what I went for. I wanted the app to read a csv
file only when I tell it to. Also I wanted to be able to add new events or reset the
database any time I wanted without stopping the app.</p>

<p>How to do this? I didn&rsquo;t want to repeat code for reading and writing to the table in a
separate script, I wanted to use the code I already had in the main app. What was already
built in to the language I could use to solve this requirement?</p>

<p>Behold! The <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Node.html">Node</a> module. The solution to all your local independent BEAM instance
communication problems. If you had multiple BEAM instances (be it Elixir or Erlang apps
and servers) running on your computer (or multiple computers) and they know each other&rsquo;s
names, then they can talk to each other.</p>

<p>So I wrote an Elixir script that would register itself with one name using <code>Node.start</code>,
start the app with another name and wait for a message from the app saying that it is
ready. Then, if you had passed any options to the script, it will run those actions as
remote calls on the main app using <code>Node.spawn</code>. It&rsquo;s good practice to make sure that your
remote calls are actual functions defined in the main app. You cannot pass an anonymous
function to the remote node via <code>Node.spawn</code> from your script if that <code>Node.spawn</code> call is
inside a module in your script (see <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/issues/1520">this issue</a> to learn more).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#fff;background-color:#111;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir"><span style="color:#080;background-color:#0f140f;font-style:italic"># you can do this if the Bar module is defined in the remote node&#39;s code</span>
defmodule Foo do
  def action do
    Node.spawn(<span style="color:#0086d2">:remote_node</span><span style="color:#ff0086;font-weight:bold">@localhost</span>, Bar, <span style="color:#0086d2">:run</span>, [<span style="color:#0086d2">opts</span>: {<span style="color:#0086f7;font-weight:bold">1</span>, <span style="color:#0086f7;font-weight:bold">2</span>}])
  end
end

<span style="color:#080;background-color:#0f140f;font-style:italic"># But you can&#39;t do this if the module Foo is not defined in the </span>
<span style="color:#080;background-color:#0f140f;font-style:italic"># remote node, even if the Bar module has been defined in the</span>

    Node.spawn(<span style="color:#0086d2">:remote_node</span><span style="color:#ff0086;font-weight:bold">@localhost</span>, fn -&gt; Bar.run(<span style="color:#0086d2">opts</span>: {<span style="color:#0086f7;font-weight:bold">1</span>, <span style="color:#0086f7;font-weight:bold">2</span>}) end)
  end
end</code></pre></div>
<p>Before anyone says anything, yes I know that this isn&rsquo;t anything brand new and game
changing. RPC has existed for decades. But I just thought this was a neat feature of the
ecosystem and I wanted to share. So here you go! Do with it what you will.</p>
