<article class="post">
    <h1 class="title"> Trying out Flutter </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p><a href="https://www.flutter.io">Flutter</a>, Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a> based SDK for building native mobile applications, has
been around for a while and I finally decided to take it for a spin. I&rsquo;ve attempted at
mobile app development before in Android but never got past Android Studio&rsquo;s terrible
slowness. Maybe it&rsquo;s because my computer is kinda old. But that doesn&rsquo;t change how bad the
experience was. Also, I just couldn&rsquo;t get Java through my head. It was more than a bit
overwhelming to try and learn.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Flutter treats the command-line as a first class citizen. Tools for
downloading packages, debugging, live reloading (hell yeah!) and building your app are all
available through the command-line. No need of any heavy, slow IDEs (though IDE
integration is definitely present). I can just do it in Emacs (although that does require
some setup to get that IDE like experience. Don&rsquo;t ask me how, I didn&rsquo;t even use
autocomplete while playing around with this. Masochism, you say? I don&rsquo;t know what you mean).</p>

<p>Flutter has some reactive elements going for it. From the developer&rsquo;s perspective, if some
action causes a state change, you can trigger a rebuild of the app by calling
<code>setState</code>. A rebuild goes back to the top of the app and cascades down the tree (the
whole app is structured like a tree, with a root, branches and leaves), applying the
changes wherever needed. But it&rsquo;s not like a browser refresh which resets
everything. Flutter is designed so that from the user perspective, they still continue to
use the app as they were and they only see the changes which have been affected. This method
allows the developer to easily reason about the app and its behaviour because there is
only one way the app applies changes to itself. Everything flows in one direction and is
easy to understand.</p>

<p>I should expand on the whole &ldquo;the app is a tree&rdquo; thing. Your UI is composed of
Widgets. Every UI element is a Widget. You have a root Widget and its children are Widgets
that make up the rest of the app. What about navigating to new screens? Flutter uses
something called <code>Navigator</code> to handle transitioning between different screens. Screens in
Flutter are called <code>Routes</code> and <code>Navigator</code> manages a stack of these <code>Routes</code>. The top of
this stack represents the current screen. Moving to a new screen involves pushing the
corresponding <code>Route</code> of the new screen to the top of the stack. Closing the current
screen pops the stack and reopens the previous screen.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s really everything I wanted to say about Flutter and my experiences with
it. Very surface level, I know. I just wanted an excuse to talk about it&rsquo;s command-line
interface and the live reloading (have I mentioned the live reloading yet?) and I wanted
to write something bigger than the length of the tweet, so here we are.</p>

<p>All in all, I think trying Flutter out ended up being a good experience. I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/secondspass/yatodo">To Do
app</a> (which is what I guess most people end up making at the start). I think the
developer experience where everything is command-line driven (especially live
reloading. I&rsquo;ll never not love Flutter&rsquo;s live reloading) and doesn&rsquo;t require a heavy IDE
is especially suited for me, which is the main reason I like it as much as I do. Dart is
pretty easy to pick up if you&rsquo;re already familiar with Java. It definitely feels like a
leaner Java (then again, I&rsquo;ve barely worked with Java so who am I to say). If ever I need
to hack a mobile app together, I think I&rsquo;ll be turning to Flutter provided I haven&rsquo;t found
something better.</p>
