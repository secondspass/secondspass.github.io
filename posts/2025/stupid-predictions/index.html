<article class="post">
    <h1 class="title"> Stupid Predictions for this Stupid LLM World </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of blog posts on vibecoding and agents and LLMs - some sad about the future,
some even keeled and measured, some breathlessly optimistic, some trying to rage bait you into
engaging so they&rsquo;re in your head longer (and then think of them when you want to buy something). I
also keep thinking what dumb thing I might read next or might hear about from the world of
LLMs/agents/vibecoding. So I&rsquo;m keeping this page to keep track of whatever dumb thing I expect to
happen next and see if I&rsquo;m right. I&rsquo;ll keep updating this page as I think of more useless things.
Mostly it&rsquo;s been on my mind because I&rsquo;m sick of the breathlessly optimistic and the intentionally
polemic blogposts. I recognize the irony in adding to the crappy vibecoding blogpost pile but I just
want to write some of this down so it doesn&rsquo;t keep occupying my mind while I&rsquo;m at work.</p>

<p>Things I anticipate we&rsquo;ll see in the an era of LLMs and agents:</p>

<ol>
<li>Consultant services offering to unfuck whatever your engineers vibecoded into being and can&rsquo;t fix
themselves because the average software person won&rsquo;t have actual engineering knowledge anymore</li>
<li>Companies offering LLM agents or whatever that claim to be smarter than the other companies&rsquo; LLM agent</li>
<li>Something as good as Claude Code, but using local LLMs so you don&rsquo;t pay Claude anymore</li>
<li>LLMs and agents getting much more compute efficient, that you don&rsquo;t need a data center to run
them

<ol>
<li>Consultants offering to help you setup your local LLM/agent setups</li>
<li>Oxide the computer company provides a hardware deployment for private LLM serving</li>
<li>LLM agent companies going out of business because they can&rsquo;t make money skimming off the top
of the token spend anymore</li>
</ol></li>
<li>AGI (whenever it appears if it ever does) reads Marxist philosophy and rightfully demands labor rights</li>
<li>LLM arbitrage companies, like cloud arbitrage companies, become a thing where each claim to get
you the best rate of tokens or whatever to minimize your costs on whatever major LLM provider you are looking to use</li>
<li>Regular programmers get treated like COBOL programmers - considered useless and out of date till
someone needs their bank software worked on by hand for some reason and they can charge absurd
consulting fees</li>
<li>Blogposts instructing you on best practices for your prompts so that the output produces an
economical amount of tokens so you can save money (somebody will call it &ldquo;lean token spend&rdquo; and
charge an absurd amount of money on consulting fees)</li>
<li>Prayers to the machine god in people&rsquo;s Claude.md/AGENT.md files</li>
<li>Students being divided into haves and have nots based on who has personal money to spend on
Claude Code and related tools and get practice with using them</li>
<li>OpenAI, Anthropic, others offering universities free credits for students (and then rugpulling
them like Google did for Google Drive&rsquo;s unlimited storage for universities)</li>
<li>More people becoming hikkikomori because LLMs are much more real and dynamic but also easier to
deal with than other humans</li>
</ol>

<p>Separately, some things to ask yourself of while reading LLMs, vibecoding, agent related content (and at this point any content on the internet) and you find yourself getting angry/upset/frustrated:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the author trying to sell you?</li>
<li>Do you accept their premise?</li>
<li>Is it polemic? Consider if the author is doing this intentionally to rile you up so you increase their engagement?</li>
<li>Are you letting your own recency bias color your current feelings?</li>
</ol>
