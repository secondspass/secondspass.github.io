    <h1 class="title"> Ordovim or: How to half ass something with (predictably) crappy results </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>I <em>love</em> Neal Stephenson&rsquo;s books. He is the God Uncle of cyberpunk
(the God<em>father</em> of cyberpunk is, of course, William Gibson). One of
Stephenson&rsquo;s doorstoppers is Cryptonomicon, a MASSIVE, 1100+ page
monstrosity jam packed with everything you could want in a historical
fiction/sorta cyberpunk novel. It&rsquo;s got action, World War
II code breaking, guest appearances by Alan Turing, digressions on
cryptography, a few predictions about the future (internet banking being
one of them. Remember, it was published in 1999) and a ton of other things
I can&rsquo;t remember. It even had graphs. <em>GRAPHS</em> for duck&rsquo;s sake.</p>

<p>Anyway, one of the things I remembered reading about in the book is Ordoemacs.
Ordoemacs is <em>the</em> text editor for the paranoid. Everything written in Ordoemacs
is automatically encrypted when written to disk. At least, that&rsquo;s how I remembered
it. So I wanted to do something similar, but in Vim. Thus, Ordovim.</p>

<p>(See that &lsquo;half ass&rsquo; in the title? Start counting them).</p>

<p>Writing a text editor from scratch is hard, really hard. Especially one with as
much power as Vim. So I chose not to bother. A Vim plugin would&rsquo;ve been easier.
(This was my first, but understandable and sane, half ass. I&rsquo;m nothing if not
pragmatic).</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have to learn Vimscript to write a plugin. And Vimscript is <em>stoopid</em>! Ugh!&ldquo;,
I whined internally. Vimscript is powerful, no doubt! I mean, just look at all
the <a href="http://vimawesome.com/">plugins</a> available. They&rsquo;re pretty rad. But my lazy bum didn&rsquo;t want to take the
time to sit down and fully learn this kinda ugly language (<a href="http://spacemacs.org/">Spacemacs</a> and Elisp&rsquo;s distant
siren song isn&rsquo;t helping either). So I decided to learn just enough to help me write
this thing. But I soon found out plugins require a greater investment in time and learning
than I was inclined to give. So I reduced the requirement from a plugin to a function and a
couple of autocommands.
(This was my second half ass. Seeing a trend?).</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you couldn&rsquo;t possibly do proper encryption with a single function.&rdquo; I hear
you say. And you&rsquo;re right. Also I knew diddly squat about cryptography. Still don&rsquo;t,
unless you call importing and using a Python library as sufficient
cryptographic expertise. And that&rsquo;s exactly what I did. <a href="https://github.com/andrewcooke/simple-crypt">Simple Crypt</a> is a
wrapper around a much more complex and powerful Python library called <a href="https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/">PyCrypto</a>.
It&rsquo;s a kiddie fence created to protect knuckleheads like me from hurting myself trying
to climb the metaphorical jungle gym. It is dead simple to use. And gave me an easy way out
from having to actually learn some cryptography.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#fff;background-color:#111;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#fb660a;font-weight:bold">from</span> simplecrypt <span style="color:#fb660a;font-weight:bold">import</span> encrypt, decrypt

plain_string = <span style="color:#0086d2">&#34;This do be a string. Fortune prick me if it is not&#34;</span>
password = <span style="color:#0086d2">&#34;yourpassword&#34;</span>

encrypted_string = encrypt(password, plain_string.encode(<span style="color:#0086d2">&#39;UTF-8&#39;</span>))
decrypted_string = decrypt(password, encrypted_string.decode(<span style="color:#0086d2">&#39;UTF-8&#39;</span>))</code></pre></div>
<p>It is literally that easy to use. I needed to do nothing else.
Ask me what SHA1 stands for and you&rsquo;ll just get a blank stare. I wrote a dead simple python script with an easy to use encryption library and added a few lines to my vimrc to
call that script whenever I opened a file with the extension <code>.ordo.enc</code>
(to decrypt it) or closed a file with the extension <code>.ordo</code> (to encrypt it).
(Half ass numero tr√®s).</p>

<p>The end result? It&rsquo;s&hellip; working? Sort of? Opening an encrypted file automatically decrypts it.
But half asses strike back! You can&rsquo;t close the file or delete the buffer and expect that
it will encrypt. Whichever buffer your &lsquo;*.ordo&rsquo; file is, only the file in the current buffer
gets encrypted. You have to switch to the buffer of the file you want to encrypt before closing it.
But hey! It&rsquo;s working. Right?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well that was a fun project!&rdquo;, I thought in my elation upon completion. &ldquo;Not half bad!&rdquo;
You know how children can sit in a cardboard box and pretend they&rsquo;re piloting a spaceship.
That was me, thinking I&rsquo;d just made a working clone of Ordoemacs with some tape and a couple
of screws. A true MacGyver is me. And so in the spirit of things, I decided to read that part
in Cryptonomicon where they talk about Ordoemacs again.</p>

<p>Recall that I mentioned at the beginning this phrase: &lsquo;Alteast, that&rsquo;s how I <em>remembered</em> it.&rsquo;
See that added emphasis on &lsquo;remembered&rsquo;? Yeah. I&rsquo;ve been going by memory all this time about how
Ordoemacs actually worked. I hadn&rsquo;t opened that book in quite a while. Here&rsquo;s the quote from the
book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OrdoEmacs, on the other hand, works exactly like regular Emacs, except that it encrypts everything before writing it out to disk. At no time is plaintext ever laid down on a disk by OrdoEmacs&ndash;the only place it exists in its plain, readable form is in the pixels on the screen, and in the volatile RAM of the computer, whence it vanishes the moment power is shut down. Not only that, but it&rsquo;s coupled to a screensaver that uses the little built-in CCD camera in the laptop to check to see if you are actually there. It can&rsquo;t recognize your face, but it can tell whether or not a vaguely human-shaped form is sitting in front of it, and if that vaguely human-shaped form goes away, even for a fraction of a second, it will drop into a screen-saver that will blank the display and freeze the machine until such time as you type in a password, or biometrically verify your identity through voice recognition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s.. well.. that&rsquo;s definitely not what I created.</p>

<p>Here was my biggest half ass of them all. My halfiest ass, if you will. I never bothered
to look at what Ordoemacs actually did before I set out to write &ldquo;Ordovim&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s look at them
one at a time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the only place it exists in its plain, readable form is in the pixels on the screen, and in the volatile RAM of the computer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, no. My &ldquo;Ordovim&rdquo; actually writes to disc first before encrypting and deleting the old plaintext file (which can easily be recovered).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>coupled to a screensaver</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>uses the little built-in CCD camera in the laptop to check to see if you are actually there</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nada.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>blank the display and freeze the machine until such time as you type in a password, or biometrically verify your identity through voice recognition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nopity nopity nope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ordovim&rdquo;, besides the fact that it does encryption, isn&rsquo;t even in the same galaxy as Ordoemacs.</p>

<p>So what was the takeaway here? Some of the things I learned at the end of this ordeal,
which should be obvious to anyone with three quarters of a brain:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t half ass things, because half asses multiply (I&rsquo;m at sixteenth ass now).</li>
<li>Read the spec or you end up with &ldquo;Ordovim&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Invest a little bit of time to learning how to use and improve your skills with your tools (even if you think they are &lsquo;stoopid&rsquo;).</li>
<li>Kiddie fences are nice, but you have to grow up sometime.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh! And go read Neal Stephenson books.</p>
