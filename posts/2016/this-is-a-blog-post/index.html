    <div class="content"> <p>This is a blog post. The first in (hopefully) a series. A series of blog posts where
I write about whatever is on my mind, probably mostly about computer stuff that I&rsquo;m doing.
An activity log, if you will. Maybe writing this is a way to organize my thoughts. Does it
work? I don&rsquo;t know! I only just started. I also find that announcing out loud that I&rsquo;m going to do
something severely decreases the chance of it ever getting done. Which is why I&rsquo;m not going to
say that I intend to write a blog post every other day.</p>

<p><em>But you just did!</em></p>

<p>I typed it. There&rsquo;s a difference.</p>

<p><em>No there isn&rsquo;t. Announcing out loud and posting on a public website are just two different forms of the same action!</em></p>

<p>Shut up Italics guy.</p>

<p>Anyway, where was I? Oh yes, organizing my thoughts. This might be a good way to debrief what I&rsquo;ve
learned. Also a good way to practice writing things out. This is an exercise for me (Lord knows I don&rsquo;t
get enough of that).</p>

<p>Now that that&rsquo;s out of the way, lets address the elephant in the room. How the <em>hell</em> did you get here?
You, yes you, the reader. Let me assure you that there other way more interesting programmer blogs out there.</p>

<li><a href="http://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Or just go visit reddit. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ashish2199/m/cs_student_subs/">multireddit</a> to get you started.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this time. Tune in next time for Subil&rsquo;s exciting adventures in Linux, or Lisp, or Python. Who knows.</p>
