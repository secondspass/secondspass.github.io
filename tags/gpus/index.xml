      <description>In the continued saga of &amp;ldquo;Subil learns how to program GPUs&amp;rdquo;, today I learned about convolution and how to program it for a GPU.
What is convolution? Well, I learned just enough so that I&amp;rsquo;m satisfied with how it works, but definitely not enough to explain it with any depth in this post. See this article or this video for explanations.
For my purposes, convolution is this: For each input element in a 2D matrix of size NxN, apply a function on it that takes that input element and some of its neighboring elements (so your input to the function is a smaller nxn matrix with your input element at the center), multiplies this smaller matrix by a another known nxn matrix called a convolution kernel or convolution filter and sums these multiplied elements together to produce one output element.</description>

      <description>(NOTE: this isn&amp;rsquo;t my best work, and its still kinda WIP, so expect inaccuracies and incomplete parts.)
I&amp;rsquo;ve working my way through Programming Massively Parallel Processors. There&amp;rsquo;s many interesting bits of knowledge I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about GPUs, and the bit I want to write down is called &amp;lsquo;corner turning&amp;rsquo;. It took me a while to wrap my head around it, so I hope this post will serve me well when I need to come back and relearn it at some point in the future.</description>
