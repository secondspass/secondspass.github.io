      <description>You know, I was supposed to be learning SQLAlchemy in the hopes adding something employable my resume (all I have right now is &amp;lsquo;knows some python&amp;rsquo;). But I end up messing around on reddit instead. Sigh.
Anyway, if you&amp;rsquo;ve used reddit for any length of time, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed a few bot accounts. They&amp;rsquo;re usually there to perform some tasks on behalf of the humans. Automoderator is ubiquitous throughout reddit. RemindMeBot can be called on demand to set a reminder for yourself by calling for it in the comments or via PM.</description>
