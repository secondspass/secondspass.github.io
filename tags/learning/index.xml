      <description>Flutter, Google&amp;rsquo;s Dart based SDK for building native mobile applications, has been around for a while and I finally decided to take it for a spin. I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted at mobile app development before in Android but never got past Android Studio&amp;rsquo;s terrible slowness. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because my computer is kinda old. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t change how bad the experience was. Also, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get Java through my head. It was more than a bit overwhelming to try and learn.</description>
