      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot of blog posts on vibecoding and agents and LLMs - some sad about the future, some even keeled and measured, some breathlessly optimistic, some trying to rage bait you into engaging so they&amp;rsquo;re in your head longer (and then think of them when you want to buy something). I also keep thinking what dumb thing I might read next or might hear about from the world of LLMs/agents/vibecoding.</description>
