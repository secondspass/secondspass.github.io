      <description>DISCLAIMER: This is not a detailed explanation of the paper, but rather just my thoughts on it.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get started on reading CS papers with a mediocre amount of success. I started with the Byzantine Generals paper but that sort of melted my brain. It was a case of me going &amp;ldquo;Holy shit, I get it!&amp;rdquo; followed by &amp;ldquo;Goddamnit, I don&amp;rsquo;t get it&amp;rdquo; again and again before I threw it away.</description>
