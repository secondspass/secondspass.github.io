      <description>Before going any further I probably need to explain what pre-commit hooks are. So Git has a facility called hooks which allow you to specify a script to execute or a command to run when some event happens. Pre-commit hooks are hooks that run before, you guessed it, a commit. There exists a single file called pre-commit in the .git/hooks directory in your git repository which will run as a script before every commit.</description>
